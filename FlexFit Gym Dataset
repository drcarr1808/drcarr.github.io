# FlexFit Gym

## Description
FlexFit Gym is a mid-sized fitness center operating in urban and suburban areas, offering a range of services including gym memberships, personal training, group classes, and an online workout platform. They have experienced steady growth over the last five years but recently noticed a drop in membership renewals and lower class attendance. The gym wants to identify potential reasons for churn and develop strategies to retain more customers.

Business Goals for the Project:

  - Analyze membership data to identify patterns and reasons for churn.
  - Segment customers based on behavior, demographics, and preferences.
  - Develop strategies to improve retention by identifying at-risk customers early.
