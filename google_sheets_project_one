**GETTING STARTED**
- Went to the website [Maven Analytics](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?order=date_added%2Cdesc&search=CRM+Sales+Opportunities)
- Downloaded and unzipped the data.

**PREPARE THE DATA FOR ANALYSIS**
- Opened the sales_pipeline.csv in Google Docs.
- Opened the sales_teams.csv in another tab.
- Checked for Blank Values
- Moved over two columns (manager and regional-office) using the XLOOKUP function. 

**EXPLORE THE DATA WITH PIVOT TABLES**
- Inserted a pivot table to show opportunities won by quarter.
- Added another pivot table (On the same sheet) to break down the percentage of won and lost opportunities by quarter.
- Created a final pivot table, one that shows the oppurtunities won by quarter for each sales agent, and sort the sales agents in descending order by opportunities won. 
- Restructured the first two pivot tables so they have the quarters as pivot table columns (Not rows) and sort them so the most recent quarter always comes first. 
 
**BUILD A DYNAMIC DASHBOARD**
- Insert a scorecard chart visual to show the opportunities won for the most recent quarter (2017-Q4) compared to the previous one (2017-Q3).
- Use a pie chart to show the percentage of opportunities won and lost in the most recent quarter.
- Use a bar chart to visualise the opportunities won by sales agent for the most recent quarter.
- Add slicers for the regional_office and manager fields.
- Finish things off by arranging the visuals into a dashboard and adding a title.
